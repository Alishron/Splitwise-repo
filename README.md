# Splitwise-repo
<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
Hi WEC , I am Alish Sahdev, a second-year student at NITK and from EEE.
Speaking of myself, I'm new to <b>android development<b> and would like to learn more from some knowledgeable guys like you . To date, I've created TIC TAC TOE, which you can see on my github. I chose the splitwise clone approach because other approaches rely on machine learning, a field in which I'm not particularly skilled. This topic intrigued me and i wanted to challenge my current knowledge and abilities through this prompt. I express my heartfelt gratitude to  @Muthukumar (+91 8921472523) and @Harshit (+91 8583905686) for all the aid they provided .<br> <hr>
<h2>ABOUT APP</h2>

I sincerely hope you like it.
