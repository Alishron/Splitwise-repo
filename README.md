# Splitwise-repo
Hi WEC , I am Alish Sahdev, a second-year student at NITK and an EEE chapter member.
Speaking of myself, I'm new to <b>android development<b> and would like to learn more from some knowledgeable veterans like you guys. To date, I've created TIC TAC TOE, which you can see on my github. I chose the splitwise clone approach because other approaches rely on machine learning, a field in which I'm not particularly skilled. So I was left with this challenging duty, which I was able to do thanks to my instructors @Muthukumar (+91 8921472523) and @Harshit (+91 8583905686).<br> 
You can actually <b>SIGN IN<b> with your Google Account on this app, and you may select which account you want to use. and after that, you can navigate between sections (such as accounts, groups, etc.), view your contacts in Friends, <b>add friends from contacts<b>, and access all information.Then you can add sums to show your total debts in groups.
I sincerely hope you enjoy my work as a novice.
